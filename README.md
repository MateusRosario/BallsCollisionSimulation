# Balls Colliding Simulation with Gravity Effect

[versão em português](README.pt.md)

Small project I made to play around with animations with JS. 
It starts random balls on the canvas with random velocities and simulates
the movements and collisions. Afterwards, I added the gravity effect 
to the balls.

Drag mouse to move throughout the space, and use mouse wheel to zoom out or in. 

Hold SHIFT key: Adds gravity effect towards the cursor 
position.

Hold ALT key: Spawns a new ball on the environment at the cursor position (mouse wheel to scale new ball).
